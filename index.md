# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Madison Palmer

Welcome to my GitHub site! I'm currently studying Business Information Systems at BYU, where I work as a TA for Statistics 121 and explore everything from web development to cybersecurity.

## üìÅ Projects & Repositories

The main highlight of my GitHub is the **[INTEX Project: Entertainment Agency Web App](https://github.com/Mjpalm13/Intex1_15)** ‚Äî a full-stack application built with React and ASP.NET Core, deployed on Azure. It was the capstone project for my BYU Information Systems Junior Core experience and showcases a complete product cycle from database design to UI deployment.

The majority of my other repositories come from my **Enterprise Web Application Development** course, where we focused on building modern apps using **.NET Core** and **React**. These projects strengthened my skills in full-stack architecture, API development, and frontend design patterns.

## üîß Technologies I Work With

- **Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks:** React, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, Tailwind
- **Tools:** Azure, GitHub, Visual Studio Code, Postman, SQL Server Management Studio
- **Concepts:** RESTful APIs, full-stack architecture, relational databases, Git workflows

## üå¥ A Little More About Me

I‚Äôm passionate about clean design, collaborative development, and bringing ideas to life through code. I also love hiking and have a deep love for exploring different cultures.

Thanks for stopping by!
